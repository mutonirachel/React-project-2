# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh



<!-- the package. json file focuses on project metadata and specifying the desired versions of dependencies, while the package-lock. json file ensures deterministic installations by locking the exact versions of dependencies and their dependencies.


A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

You can use <></> the same way you'd use any other element except that it doesn't support keys or attributes. -->
